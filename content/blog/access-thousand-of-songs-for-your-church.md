In the worship experience, song lyrics play a crucial role right alongside scripture. There’s something powerful about following a song with the correct lyrics, and it can be incredibly eye-opening to finally see the right words to a song you may have been singing incorrectly.

At Cloud of Worship, we understand how important it is to get the lyrics right, which is why we’ve made it a top priority. One of the ways we help with this is by preloading our song library with **over 7,000 songs**—and that number continues to grow as more churches contribute their own songs.

## How Cloud of Worship Connects Churches through Song

Cloud of Worship creates a connected environment where churches can share songs with one another. When your church adds a song to the platform, it is first added to your **personal library**. With your permission, it can also be shared globally for other churches to access and use.

## Adding a Song to Your Library

To add a song to your library, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the **Quick Actions Pane**.
2. Search for **“Add Song”**.
3. Fill in the three basic fields required to upload the song.

It’s that easy! Once the song is added, it will be available in your personal library for immediate use.

## Sharing Your Song Library with Others

We believe in sharing because it strengthens the worship experience across communities. That’s why we encourage you to keep the checkbox that says **“Share this song with other users?”** activated on your account. This enables other churches to benefit from the songs you’ve added, fostering a larger collection of shared worship music.

Remember, sharing is caring—and by contributing to the global library, you’re helping others worship with the right lyrics, just like you.

## Key Highlights:

•	Access **over 7,000** preloaded songs in the Cloud of Worship library.

•	Add your own songs to your **personal library** and share them globally with other churches.

•	Use the **Quick Actions Pane** to easily add new songs.
