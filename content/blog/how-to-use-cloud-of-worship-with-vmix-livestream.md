3. **Adjust Resolution (Optional):** In the settings, you may want to set the resolution to match your livestream quality.

- **Adjust Audio (If Applicable):** If you’re streaming audio from Cloud of Worship, double-check audio levels in vMix to maintain balanced sound quality.
- **Use Hotkeys (Advanced):** If you frequently switch between different inputs, consider setting up hotkeys in vMix to toggle Cloud of Worship on and off quickly.

## Known Issues and Limitations
