In many Ghanaian churches, Twi-speaking members attend faithfully, yet Scripture is often presented primarily in English. While the message is heard, it is not always fully absorbed.

Language affects understanding.

### Why Twi Matters in Church Services

When Scripture appears in Twi:

- Congregants follow more confidently
- The message resonates culturally
- Worship becomes more expressive

Inclusion isn’t about changing the Gospel, it’s about communicating it clearly.

### The Common Struggles Churches Face

- Switching between English and Twi manually
- Slow transitions during Bible reading
- Media volunteers overwhelmed
- Limited software flexibility

These small disruptions reduce the flow of worship.

### Supporting Multilingual Worship the Right Way

Churches need tools that:

- Support multiple Bible translations
- Allow instant switching
- Display side-by-side Scripture cleanly
- Work smoothly during live services

Cloud of Worship is designed with these realities in mind.

For churches in Accra, Kumasi, and across Ghana, integrating Twi Bible projection can transform engagement and participation during service.

Because worship deepens when understanding increases.
