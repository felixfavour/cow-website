## Performance and Hardware Recommendations

While Cloud of Worship is built to work efficiently even on older computers, like most software, it performs better on devices with more powerful hardware. Here’s what to keep in mind:

### **Cloud of Worship on Older Computers**

If you’re using a machine with an older processor, you may experience slower performance, especially when you have over 20 slides in the active service schedule. In such cases, we recommend:

1. Deleting slides that are no longer in use.
2. Avoiding the duplication of slides unnecessarily to ensure smoother performance.

### **Cloud of Worship on Newer or High-Spec Devices**

For the best experience, we recommend using a computer with a more modern processor and sufficient RAM. This will help Cloud of Worship run faster and more efficiently, even when managing a large number of slides or media.

## Recommended Browsers

Cloud of Worship works on all major browsers, but for the best experience, we recommend using a **Chromium-based browser** such as:

1. **Google Chrome**

These browsers offer the most optimized experience with Cloud of Worship, ensuring faster load times, smoother slide transitions, and more reliable performance.
