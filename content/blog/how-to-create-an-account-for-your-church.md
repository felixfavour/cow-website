Creating an account on Cloud of Worship for your church is quick and easy. Just follow these two simple steps:

## Step 1: Sign Up as an Administrator

Start by creating an administrator account. Here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. **Enter your full name**
2. **Provide your email address**
3. **Create a secure password**: Make sure your password includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and a number. For example, you can use something like CloudofWorship1.

Once you’ve filled in these details, click “Create your account” to complete this step.

## Step 2: Link Your Admin Account to Your Church’s Workspace

Now that you’ve set up your administrator account, it’s time to create a workspace for your church. This allows other members to join and collaborate easily.

1. **Select Your Church**: From the dropdown list, choose your church. If your church isn’t listed, select “Other Church.” Don’t worry—we are constantly adding new churches to the platform!
2. **Name Your Branch or Campus**: If your church has multiple branches, zones, or campuses, enter the unique name of your branch so that it’s easily recognizable. This helps distinguish your church from others.
3. **Enter the Name of Your Senior Pastor**: The last detail we’ll need is the name of your Senior Pastor or resident Pastor.

Once you’ve entered all this information, you’re all set! 

**You’re Ready to Use Cloud of Worship!**

That’s it! You’ve successfully created your account and church workspace. Now, you can start using Cloud of Worship to collaborate with your team, share slides, and much more.
