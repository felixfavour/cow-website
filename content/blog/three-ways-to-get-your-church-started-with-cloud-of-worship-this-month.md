Youâ€™ve discovered CoW. Youâ€™ve signed up. But how do you get your church, fellowship, or ministry team to embrace it too? Here's a practical guide to help your community take the leap from interest to implementation.

1. Share the Onboarding Video or Host a Live Demo
2. Run a Trial Service with Your Media Lead or Pastor
3. Assign a 'CoW Champion' in Your Church

Letâ€™s talk about this in detail:

### 1. Share the Onboarding Video or Host a Live Demo

You donâ€™t have to explain everything yourself. Use the official onboarding video or invite your team to a brief Zoom or Google Meet walkthrough. Showing the app in action can build instant buy-in.

### 2. Run a Trial Service with Your Media Lead or Pastor

Select a low-pressure service (like a prayer night or youth meeting) to try CoW in real time. Keep it simple. Prepare slides together and test the full flow from Laptop to display.

### 3. Assign a 'CoW Champion' in Your Church

Adoption is smoother when someone leads the process. Appoint a tech-savvy or committed person to oversee setup, help others onboard, and answer questions.

ðŸ’¡Bonus: Share Real-Life Testimonials

Send your leadership feedback from other churches using CoW successfully. Peer validation builds trust and encourages others to try.

Every movement starts with a first step. Whether youâ€™re in a media department or just passionate about helping your church grow, introducing CoW this month could be the beginning of smoother, simpler services for everyone involved.
