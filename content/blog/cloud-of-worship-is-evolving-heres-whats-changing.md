At Cloud of Worship, our mission has always been simple: **to help churches focus on worship, not technology**.

As more churches joined the platform, we listened closely to what worked, what slowed teams down, and where technology quietly became a burden. That feedback shaped every improvement we’ve made so far.

To keep building a **hitch-free, reliable, and intuitive worship platform**, Cloud of Worship is moving to a **paid plan**. This step allows us to invest deeper into performance, offline reliability, collaboration, and long-term support, so every church, regardless of size, can lead worship with confidence.

To make this transition easy, **every user gets 1 month of upgraded access for free**, so you can experience the full power of Cloud of Worship before deciding.
