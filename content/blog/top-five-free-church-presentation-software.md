Churches are always looking for the best ways to enhance their worship services without breaking the budget. One crucial tool is church presentation software that helps display lyrics, scriptures, and sermon slides seamlessly.

If you're searching for a free or cost-effective solution, we've compiled the top five free church presentation software options for your church to consider in 2025.

### Why Church Presentation Software Matters

Church presentation software simplifies the technical aspects of the service experience, allowing media and worship teams to focus on delivering impactful services. 

Features like seamless lyric projection, scripture display, and media integration improve engagement and ensure smooth service flow. Many churches rely on these tools to create visually appealing and organized worship services that encourage congregation participation.

By using the right software, churches can save time on preparation while maintaining high-quality presentations that resonate with the congregation.

### 1. OpenLP

OpenLP is an open-source church presentation software offering a range of features, including PowerPoint integration, media playback, and remote control access. It’s completely free and great for churches that need a no-cost, customizable solution. 

OpenLP supports Linux, Windows, and macOS, making it accessible across various devices. However, it can be hard to learn, the design feels outdated, and it doesn’t handle videos as well as some paid options. The mobile remote feature can also be unreliable.

### 2. EasyWorship (Free Version)

EasyWorship provides a free trial version that includes essential features such as lyric slides, video support, and scripture display. While the full version requires payment, the free version can be useful for small congregations. 

EasyWorship is known for its user-friendly interface, making it ideal for churches that want to transition smoothly from traditional slides to digital presentations. **The free version is limited, and the full version requires payment. While it’s easy to use, smaller churches may find the free plan too restrictive for their needs.**

### 3. Worship Extreme (Free Plan)

Worship Extreme’s free plan offers cloud storage, presentation tools, and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for seamless service planning. The software allows teams to synchronize presentations across multiple locations, making it perfect for churches with online or multi-campus services. 

Its integration with various media sources enhances worship experiences by providing access to a library of songs, videos, and scriptures in real time. **Some features are only available in the paid version, and churches needing more customization may find the free plan limiting.**

### 4. ProPresenter (Limited Free Version)

ProPresenter is a professional-grade worship presentation software with a free version that includes limited features but still allows churches to display lyrics and scripture. While the paid version unlocks advanced features like live streaming support, the free version is a great starting point for churches that need a reliable presentation tool. 

ProPresenter is widely used in larger churches for its robust media handling capabilities and high-definition video support. Many advanced features, like live streaming, require the paid version, and its tech-heavy setup may be challenging for smaller churches or less tech-savvy users.

### 5. [Cloud of Worship](https://cloudofworship.com/)

Unlike other options, Cloud of Worship is a fully browser-based platform with offline capabilities, eliminating the need for installations and complex setups. It’s free to use with essential features and designed specifically to streamline church services. With an intuitive interface and multi-device accessibility, Cloud of Worship is ideal for churches looking for a simple yet powerful solution.

**Cloud of Worship supports multimedia integration, enabling churches to incorporate worship videos, sermon illustrations, and live-streamed services into your presentations.**

This added flexibility ensures that worship services remain engaging and dynamic, helping churches connect with their congregations on a deeper level.

Another key benefit of Cloud of Worship is its ability to support remote teams. Worship leaders can plan services from anywhere, ensuring that even those who are not physically present in the church can collaborate on worship presentations.
