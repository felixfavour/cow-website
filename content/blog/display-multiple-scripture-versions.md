Scripture is an essential part of your church’s service, and seeing verses in different translations can provide even greater depth and understanding. That’s why Cloud of Worship includes multiple (public domain) Bible translations for you to use locally during services.

## Changing the Bible Version on a Slide

To update the Bible version on a slide:

1. Navigate to the **Preview and Edit Content Pane**.
2. Click on the **Bible slide** you wish to modify.
3. Use the **Bible Version Selector** to choose your preferred translation. By default, the King James Version (KJV) is selected.

## Adding More Bible Versions

If you’d like to add more Bible translations:

1. Click the **“Add More”** button in the **Bible Version Selector**.
2. You will be redirected to the **Settings Page**, where you can download additional Bible versions.

This feature allows you to tailor the scripture display to fit the needs of your congregation, offering a richer, more diverse scriptural experience.

## Key Highlights:

- Switch between Bible versions easily using the **Bible Version Selector**.
- **Add more translations** via the settings page to enhance your service.
- Default version is set to **King James Version (KJV)**, but other translations are just a click away.
